# Military Asset Management System - Video Walkthrough Script
**Duration**: 3-5 minutes  
**Target Audience**: Technical reviewers and stakeholders

---

## ðŸŽ¬ **Video Structure & Timing**

### **INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)**
*[Show project structure/code editor]*

**Script:**
"Hello! I'm presenting the Military Asset Management System - a full-stack web application built for managing military assets across multiple bases with role-based access control. 

This system handles asset tracking, purchases, transfers, assignments, and expenditures with complete audit trails. Let me walk you through the architecture and key features."

### **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (0:30 - 1:30)**
*[Show SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md file with the following key points]:*

**"Let me walk you through our system architecture..."**

1. **Three-Tier Architecture**: 
   - Frontend (Next.js on Vercel)
   - Backend (Express.js on Railway) 
   - Database (PostgreSQL on Railway)

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Frontend: Next.js 15, TailwindCSS, React Query
   - Backend: Express.js, Prisma ORM, JWT auth
   - Database: PostgreSQL with role-based access

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Frontend: App Router with protected routes
   - Backend: RESTful APIs with middleware
   - Database: Prisma schema with migrations

*[Refer to the visual diagrams and detailed breakdown in SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md]*

**Script:**
"The system uses a modern three-tier architecture:

**Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, using Prisma ORM for PostgreSQL database access. I implemented JWT authentication with middleware-based RBAC supporting three roles: Admin with full access, Base Commander limited to their base, and Logistics Officer for purchases and transfers.

**Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and TailwindCSS for responsive design. React Query handles server state management efficiently.

**Database**: PostgreSQL with a comprehensive schema supporting asset lifecycle tracking, multi-base operations, and complete audit trails through API logging.

The challenging part here was designing the relational model to handle complex asset movements while maintaining data integrity and supporting role-based filtering at the database level."

### **CORE FUNCTIONALITY DEMO (1:30 - 3:30)**
*[Live application demo]*

**Script:**
"Let me demonstrate the core features:

*[Login screen]*
Starting with authentication - I'll log in as the admin user.

*[Dashboard]*
The dashboard shows real-time metrics: Opening Balance, Closing Balance, Net Movement with detailed breakdown, Assigned and Expended assets. Notice the filters for date range, base, and equipment type. Clicking Net Movement reveals the detailed breakdown - this was manually implemented with complex SQL aggregations.

*[Assets page]*
Here's asset management with full CRUD operations. Notice how Base Commanders only see their base's assets - this role-based filtering happens at both API and database levels.

*[Purchases page]*
The purchases page allows recording asset procurement. I manually handled the relationship between assets, bases, and quantities with proper validation.

*[Transfers page]*
Transfers between bases - one of the trickiest parts. I implemented transaction-based transfers to ensure data consistency, preventing scenarios like transferring more assets than available.

*[Assignments page]*
Finally, personnel assignments and expenditure tracking with complete audit trails."

### **TECHNICAL CHALLENGES (3:30 - 4:30)**
*[Show code snippets/database schema]*

**Script:**
"Let me highlight the technically challenging parts I handled manually:

**Opening/Closing Balance Calculations**: I implemented complex SQL aggregations to calculate balances across time periods, accounting for purchases, transfers in/out, and expenditures. This required careful handling of date ranges and base-specific filtering.

**Role-Based Data Access**: Rather than just UI-level restrictions, I implemented database-level filtering where Base Commanders automatically see only their base data through middleware that modifies queries.

**Transaction Integrity**: For transfers, I used Prisma transactions to ensure atomicity - either the transfer completes fully or rolls back entirely.

**API Logging**: Every critical operation logs to an audit table with user context, action type, and entity details for compliance requirements.

**Real-time Dashboard Metrics**: The dashboard calculations happen in real-time with optimized queries, handling complex aggregations across multiple tables efficiently."

---

### **CLOSING & DEPLOYMENT (4:30 - 5:00)**
*[Show documentation/deployment guide]*

**Script:**
"The system is production-ready with comprehensive documentation, step-by-step deployment guides, and sample data. It includes:

- Complete PostgreSQL database dump with test data
- Environment configuration examples  
- Troubleshooting guides
- Security best practices

The entire codebase, database, and documentation are packaged in a single ZIP file for easy deployment. 

This system fully meets all military asset management requirements with enterprise-grade security, audit compliance, and scalable architecture. Thank you!"
